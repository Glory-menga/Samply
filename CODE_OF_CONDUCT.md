We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
